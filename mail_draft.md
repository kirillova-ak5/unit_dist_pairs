Hello!

My name is arina, i am a student of SPbSTU (full name).
I saw the problem of pairs of vertices at unit distance, given in the article (link).
I was interested in this topic for my scientific work on computational geometry.
Please tell me do you investigate this problem later?
Can you recommend any specific approaches to try to solve it?

Thank you for your time,
arina
