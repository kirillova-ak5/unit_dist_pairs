Hello dear Professor!

My name is Arina, i am a student of Peter the Great St.Petersburg Polytechnic University.  
I saw the problem of pairs of vertices at unit distance, given in the article Agarwal P. K., O'Rourke J. Computational geometry column 34 //arXiv preprint cs/9808008. â€“ 1998.  
I was interested in this topic for my student scientific work on computational geometry.
We start our research with analysing low-sized polygons and try all combinations for 5 and 6-gon. It seems like number of unit pairs is linear, but for bigger polygons this approach is not suitable.
Please tell me do you investigate this problem later?  
Can you recommend any specific approaches to try to solve it?

Thank you for your time,
