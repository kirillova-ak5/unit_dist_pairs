Dear Arina,


  I did not work on the unit distance question for convex position for a long time.  I believe the 2n-7 lower bound with Hajnal is still the best, and there is no matching linear upper bound known.  There is however a very nice O(nlogn) bound by Fueredi, which you probably know about already.


Best Wishes and Good Luck,

  Herbert
